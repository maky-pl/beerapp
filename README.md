Beer search engine build with Angular CLI. (beer list with infinite scroll, beer details in a modal, similar beers in a modal, search beer by name, data loading spinner)
Routing:
  * /beers/ displays the whole list
  * /beers/id (e.g. /beers/3) displays details of a beer with the given ID
  * /search;name=NAME (e.g. /search;name=buzz) displays search results

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to "http://localhost:4200/"
